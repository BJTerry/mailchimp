# Introduction

This is a library for interacting with Mailchimp's JSON API in Haskell. The package is as yet fairly untested, and my not deal properly with all of the potential idiosyncrasies of the Mailchimp API. Also, it currently only implements the "lists" section of the API. The documentation is currently the best source of info.

If you'd like to see a version that builds under 7.6 (to run on FP Haskell Center), look at the FPComplete branch.
